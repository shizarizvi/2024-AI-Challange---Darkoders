First things first, let's talk about your portfolio. Think of it as your tech resume. It's where you show off your skills and
what you can do. Here's how to make it stand out:


Projects, Projects, Projects: Start by working on projects, whether it's coding a website, designing an app, or solving
a tech problem. Your portfolio is all about what you've actually done.
Quality Over Quantity: It's not about having a million projects; it's about having a few impressive ones. Focus on
projects that highlight your skills and interests.
Explain Your Work: Don't just show what you've done; explain how you did it. Describe the challenges you faced and
how you overcame them. Employers love problem solvers!

In recent years, the field of software engineering has witnessed significant growth in Pakistan, attracting foreign
investors and creating job roles for talented individuals. From developing mobile applications to designing complex
systems, software engineers play a crucial role in shaping the digital landscape of today.

in the industry. As more businesses and organisations digitise their operations, there is a growing need for software
developers who can design, develop, and maintain software applications.

The average salary for a software engineer in Pakistan ranges from PKR 120,000 to PKR 250,000 per month,
depending on experience, skill level, and employer. This range is quite competitive compared to other professions in
Pakistan, making software engineering a financially rewarding career choice.

Additionally, the rise of remote work opportunities has opened up new avenues for software engineers in Pakistan.
With advancements in technology and communication tools, many software developers can now work remotely for
international companies, earning competitive salaries while enjoying the flexibility of working from home.

This trend has further increased job opportunities for software engineers in Pakistan, allowing them to work with
global clients and expand their professional networks.

Currently, a recurring debate revolves around the importance of a degree versus the option of solely acquiring a
skillset to initiate a career or business. However, this perspective is not entirely accurate.

Both are valuable if you want to pursue a career as a software engineer.

If you ask why a degree is important, then I can give you one short answer: it will build your basic foundations. When
you attend any university or get admission, you first learn about teamwork and communication, which are important
soft skills.

A degree isn’t just a piece of paper; it’s your ability to showcase how you can deal with problems.

On the other hand, a skillset is all about practical work. If you have perfect skills in a particular area, you can work
for any organisation without worrying about how to solve issues or how to communicate with clients, because you’ve
already learned those aspects during your university life.

Both have ideological importance, and you can’t neglect this fact.

Don’t apply for jobs blindly without reading their job descriptions to understand what companies are looking for. If
you fulfil their requirements, then you can apply for that job, instead of just clicking on the ‘apply now‘ button every
time. While salary matters, consider gaining experience even at a lower salary if it will boost your expectations for
higher salaries in the future.

The estimated total pay for a Software Engineer is PKR 150,000 per month in the Pakistan area, with an average
salary of PKR 120,000 per month. These numbers represent the median, which is the midpoint of the ranges from
our proprietary Total Pay Estimate model and based on salaries collected from our users. The estimated additional
pay is PKR 30,000 per month. Additional pay could include cash bonus, commission, tips, and profit sharing. The
"Most Likely Range" represents values that exist within the 25th and 75th percentile of all pay data available for this
role.

Companies in pakistan with their pay range for IT professionals:
  ● Arbisoft = PKR 76K to PKR 140K
  ● I2c = PKR 80K to PKR 156K
  ● Netsol = PKR 51K to PKR 100K

Jonathan Siddharth, the CEO and co-founder of California-based IT company Turing, said Pakistan is emerging as
among the top choices for US companies as they look to ramp up their software development teams.

Turing, which enables businesses to hire software engineers from around the world, announced in June that it was
now focusing its efforts towards attracting more software developers in Pakistan as it identifies the South Asian
economy as a high-potential market.
Turing matches remote developers with long-term jobs and enlists them to work with leading US-based companies.
Developers negotiate their own salaries. Turing charges the companies a premium for using its platform.

US-based Turing eyes Pakistan's software engineers as it expands in South Asia

“Software exports is a booming industry bringing significant revenue to national economies,” said Siddharth in
response to queries sent by Business Recorder.

“Countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are fast emerging as top choices to ramp up software development
teams. The tech talent of these countries is a significant asset that can bring endless opportunities in terms of
foreign exchange to the national exchequer by exporting their expertise.”

Turing was founded in 2018 by Siddharth and Vijay Krishnan, who is now stated as Chief Technology Officer.
Siddharth said Turing is functional in 150 countries, and has over 1.5 million software developers on its platform.

Details on its website suggest that it conducts live interviews and tests lasting more than five hours during its own
vetting process, which includes checking for soft skills.

There has also been an increase in the number of IT programmes and courses in the country that have helped many
aspiring developers build their aptitude: Turing CEO

Siddharth said Turing was functional in Pakistan for a while, but is now actively looking for software engineers.

“Seeing the rich developer talent Pakistan houses, we are actively looking for software engineers to provide them
with a community where they can scale their careers by accessing remote job opportunities with leading firms in the
US,” he said.

The CEO said Pakistan has also seen impressive growth in its IT industry in the past few years, producing some of
the best software engineers in the region.

“There has also been an increase in the number of IT programmes and courses in the country that have helped
many aspiring developers build their aptitude. Pakistani developers are just as competent as developers from any
high-tech country. They simply need the right opportunities.”

Siddharth said the platform would help Pakistani developers connect with the top US firms, bridging the gap
between foreign and local markets. However, the CEO did not share the number of Pakistani software developers
currently on Turing’s platform.

He added that Turing has itself seen phenomenal growth, and raised a total of over $140 million in the Series D
financing round from investors including UK-based WestBridge Capital, US-based Foundation Capital, Stanford
StartX, and executives from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon.

Siddharth said the round takes Turing’s valuation to over $4 billion.

“We plan on utilising this valuation to grow and build a category-defining company. We are experiencing a
generational shift in how we work with the remote-first concept gaining quick, widespread popularity. We aim to
leverage this shift by democratising opportunities for the global developer talent base and helping companies benefit
from this talent without any geographically-inflicted limitations.

“Currently, Turing has 1.5 million developers listed on its platform from 150 countries, thousands of whom have
already been connected with more than 300 top US firms, including Johnson & Johnson, Dell, Disney, Coinbase,
Plume, and VillageMD. As we move ahead, our mission is to deepen our global presence by onboarding more
talented developers from around the world, expand our customer base to include more top high-profile US firms, and
rapidly scale our efforts to help our community of developers grow and succeed in their careers.”

Software Engineering Fresh Graduates Career Choices and Software Industry Demands: An Empirical Analysis
Nosheen Qamar, Hafiza Maria Kiran, Fatima Ahmad, Shehla Saeed, Beenish Abid 1Department of Computer
Science and Information Technology, The University of Lahore, Pakistan. Abstract Software Engineering is one of
the modern engineering disciplines. The efficiency, novelty, creativity, and excellence of the products and services of
the software industry significantly depend on the education being provided in universities. Bearing in mind the
petition for experienced software engineers in the market and the software industry’s emergent demands and trends,
empirical analysis has been done by collecting the data from fresh software engineering graduates, professionals in
the field of software engineering and online job portals. The main focus behind this study is basically to guide final
year software engineering students to start a career in the specific areas (requirements engineering, software
analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance) of software engineering, identified by mapping the
interest of fresh graduates, professional software engineers, and software industry demand. Our results show that
professionals' feedback is similar to the jobs available on portals, which means our professionals provided more
realistic feedback. Also, results show that more people are interested in requirement engineering but jobs are very
limited in requirement engineering, software design, and testing. As far as software analysis, software
implementation and software maintenance are concerned, professionals suggest that more people should select
these areas as there are more job opportunities here. To summaries, there is a positive relationship between
professionals’ feedback and industry job openings. Both suggest software implementation is the richest job area.
The state-of-the-art syllabus can be planned for software engineering program by keeping in mind the trends and
demands of the software industry. Keywords: Career Choices, Software Development, Software Engineering,
Software Industry 1. Introduction Some researchers in the field of computer science started to utilize the term
"Software Engineering" during 1960s without providing a reasonable definition [1,2]. They communicated the
expectation that software developers would figure out how to develop their applications with control and
demonstrable skills. Prof. Brian Randell defined the term software engineering as “multi-person development of
multi-version programs” [3]. The educational community in the field of computer science has been energetic for over
three decades [4]. The general objective of education in the field of software engineering is to deliver an
academically solid system to instructors [5]. The development of any part of software comprises of a human
component. It requires some tasks such as problem-solving, logical thinking, communication, and psychological
thinking [6]. Additionally, there are different activities involved in software development life cycle (SDLC) i.e.
requirements engineering, software design, coding/implementation, testing, and maintenance. In SDLC, the phase
of requirement engineering is mostly recognized as the most difficult process [12]. In the requirements engineering
process, software engineers use different sources to collect requirements from stakeholders. Software
design/architecture is a high-level structure of a software system that comprises on useful system organization [13].
Writing programs to implement requirements as per defined architecture/structure arise under software
implementation phase. To examine that how the system behaves according to the given input and identification of
faults is called software testing [14]. Adding new features, enhancements, and modifications in the existing system
are done in the software maintenance phase [15]. All the activities involved software engineering i.e. effort
estimation [16], designing and architecture [17], testing [18], etc. demand specific personal having different relevant
skills and abilities for fulfillment. It has been testified that numerous fresh graduates in the field of software
engineering frequently face challenges while entering in their professional careers. The excellence of the software
engineering personnel is a straight result of software engineering education as well as how software engineering
students are skilled. In any case, there is a generally noted gap between the education that graduates get from
universities and the skills that are needed by the software industry. Despite the fact, several university programs
largely pay attention to the core or fundamental areas of computer science whereas the areas of software
engineering do not get as much consideration. It is generally acknowledged that better tutoring of the students in the
field of software engineering will set them up in an improved way to start their careers in software engineering after
graduation and will expand their skills and capability. Hence, it's an ideal opportunity to endorse the extensive
progress of the program of software engineering degree. Currently, there is a wide range of software applications
that are being used efficiently in almost every stage of day-to-day life

According to this viewpoint, software engineering plays a vital role in this development. As the nature of the working
environment in software industries is diverse, energetic and self-motivated, so human resources like software
engineers and other important actors probably have a variety of regularly changing skills, tasks, and responsibilities
[8,9]. Many software engineering jobs are posted on different job portals regularly. From this point of view, these
software engineering job postings can be considered to identify market demand and skills requires by professionals
[10,11]. In this paper, a survey is conducted from fresh software engineering graduates, software engineering
professionals and job portals to conduct a comparison between supply (interest of fresh software engineering
graduates) and demand (job openings in the software industry in specific areas/phases of software engineering by
taking software experts feedback and online job portals). The purpose of this study is to guide fresh graduates in
their career choices so that they can improve their skills and start their careers as per the software industry’s most
in-demand area. The rest of the article is structured as follows. The next section describes the literature review in
this area. Section III explains our research methodology. Section IV analyzes the results of our study. Lastly, section
V will provide the conclusions of the study. 2. LITERATURE REVIEW Software engineering is an immensely
energetic field. Education and training in the field of software engineering are dynamic regions among the
professionals’ networks and education research [19-22]. Researchers in the field of software engineering has done a
lot of research to highlight the industry requirement regarding computing positions for new employees and the
training being provided to the computer science students in the field of software engineering. Keeping in mind the
petition for skilled software engineers in the future, an empirical analysis based on a probabilistic generative method
for topic modeling (latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)). is conducted in [23] to provide important bits of knowledge and
Influence on software engineering education. Empirical analysis has shown that the software industry has a wide
spectrum regarding proficient jobs, duties relevant to popular skills, and a mix of programming languages. This study
has also emphasized a comprehensive series of software engineering characteristic i.e. methodologies, skills,
trends, demands, platforms and technologies, which specify the progress and growth in the software engineering
field. It is normally recommended that the courses of computer science are created in a space with a minimum or no
respect for the real-world needs of the student's ultimate employer ([24], [25]). The people in the field of academics
and the software industry are constantly debating on the matter of the gap between the education that is being
delivered to computer science students and the industry demands regarding new workers in computing relevant
fields. A survey was conducted in the domain of information technology regarding the identification of skills and they
concluded that soft skills are more needed in the industry [26]. It would be more appropriate to focus on the ability
and the competence that is needed for a software engineer to work in the industry rather than to look at programs or
syllabus that is being taught in universities [27]. Another research has shed light on the significance of soft skills and
hard skills for the position of the fresh software engineer. This study recommends that soft skills are suggestively
more vital than hard skills [28]. Still, gaps exist between what the industry demands and the skills graduates have. A
study is conducted to observe the skills gap between software engineering applications and software engineering
curriculum [24]. This study has identified some of the reasons that cause this gap and also suggested some
possibilities to bridge the gap. The study highlighted that working in such an industry having a dynamic pattern and a
fast-changing environment is the major reason for the gap. By providing an appropriate software engineering
curriculum to the university and building a connection between the university and industry employees can be a
solution to bridge the gap. In [29], it is stated that practical skills are more significant for the one who has to start a
career in the field of software engineering whereas non-technical skills are required or have more importance for the
one who has developed the career [30]. Hence, learning for skills and knowledge is essential for software engineers
during the permanency of their careers. It is the fact that there is no traditional agreement concerning essential skills
mandatory for software engineers. Problems in evaluating skill status may starts from the circumstance that skill
demands change as experts found their careers. 3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Figure 1 depicts the different
steps of our research methodology. As is evident from this figure, the first step of our research was survey of fresh
graduates. The survey of professionals was the next step of our research methodology. Data collection related to
software engineering jobs under different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC) is the third step. The
last step is the analysis of collected results from surveys and online job portals.
IJCSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, VOL.18 No.12, December 2018 74
Figure 1. Research Methodology 3.1 Survey of Fresh Graduates A survey of fresh graduates (from the private
sector university of Pakistan) was carried out to know the career choices of these graduates. A total of 368 fresh
graduates took part in our survey. All these were graduates of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) and
Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering (BSSE). All these graduates enrolled in the university in the year of
2015 and passed out in 2019. 3.2 Survey of Professionals During the second step of our research methodology, a
survey of Pakistani software industry professionals was carried out. The purpose of this survey was to know that
according to industry professionals which phase of software development life cycle (SDLC) has more job openings.
An online survey form was circulated in industry professionals. A total of 51 professionals participated in our survey.
Industry professionals were asked to submit their work experience, their role in companies, their rank in the
company, and which phases of SDLC have more opportunities for fresh graduates. Figure 2 describes the work
experience of professionals. It can be seen from this figure that around 85% of respondents were having more than
five years of work experience. This strengthens the reliability of our results. Figure 2. Work Experience of
Respondents Figure 3 shows the role of respondents in their respective companies. Around 31% of the
respondents were CEOs/presidents/owners or directors of the companies which have more software industry
exposure in the business perspective. Around 23% of participants were principal software engineers whereas 23%
were senior software engineers. 7.7% were the HR managers in their respective companies and 23% were having
anonymous designation in their companies. Figure 3. Role of Respondents in their Respective Companies Figure
4 demonstrates the rank of professionals in their respective companies. It can be seen in the figure that around 61%
of the participants were the project managers of the companies who leads the projects and creates new job
openings in the field of software engineering.

phases of SDLC made by fresh graduates in numbers and percentages, respectively. Professionals’ feedback
regarding job openings in different phases of SDLC is given in columns V and VI. The last two columns contain the
number and percentage of job openings in the top three selected portals of results. Figure 5 depicts the comparison
between career choices and professionals’ feedback. The fresh graduates have more career interest in
requirements engineering whereas very few professionals suggest choosing this area as they think there are very
few job opportunities available in Pakistan software Industry. The same is the case for software design and software
testing. The case is opposite for software analysis, software development, and software maintenance as
professionals feel that more people should come in these areas and according to them, these areas have more job
opportunities. Figure 5. Comparison Between Fresh Graduates’ Career Choices and Professionals’ Feedback

area. Figure 7. Comparison Between Professionals’ Feedback and Job Portals. 4 CONCLUSION In this paper,
we aim to examine the needs and trends of the software engineering industry and to expose the suggestions for
education in the field of software engineering. To this end, empirical analysis has been conducted by collecting the
data from fresh software engineering graduates, professionals in the field of software engineering and online job
portals to identify the software industry’s demand and career choice of fresh software engineering graduates. Our
results show that software engineering fresh graduates are more interested in requirement engineering whereas
professionals and online job portals say that there are very few job opportunities regarding requirement engineering
in the
IJCSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, VOL.20 No.12, December 2020 77
Pakistan software Industry as most of the software houses are medium to small scale and they don’t hire specialized
requirements engineers. Similarly, software design and software testing both are low in demand in the software
industry. The case is quite different in software analysis where jobs are available, but few graduates are interested in
this area. According to professionals’ feedback and online job openings, people should come in areas like software
analysis, software development, and software maintenance as these areas have more job opportunities in the
market. As there is a positive relationship in industry job openings and professionals’ feedback, so, to sum up, the
discussion, software development is the most demanding job area in the software industry. The results can provide
remarkable suggestions for the software industry, academic world, and professional software engineers to fill the gap
between education in the field of software engineering and industry’s demand. It can also play a vital role in planning
state-of-the-art syllabus for software engineering programs by keeping in mind the trends and demands of the
software industry.
An entry-level Software Engineer with less than 1 year experience can expect to earn an average total
compensation (includes tips, bonus, and overtime pay) of Rs 715,365 based on 73 salaries. An early career
Software Engineer with 1-4 years of experience earns an average total compensation of Rs 978,505 based on 677

                                    PREFACE
The curriculum, with varying definitions, is said to be a roadmap or plan of teaching-
learning process that students of an academic program are required to undergo. It
includes objectives and learning outcomes, course contents, scheme of studies, teaching
approaches, and assessment methodologies. Since knowledge in all fields and sectors is
expanding at a faster pace and new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that
curricula should be dynamic having regular review and updation.
The University Grants Commission (UGC) was designated as the competent authority
to develop, review and revise curricula beyond Class-XII vides Section 3, Sub-Section
2 (ii), Act of Parliament No. X of 1976 titled “Supervision of Curricula and Textbooks
and Maintenance of Standard of Education”. With the repeal of UGC Act, the same
function was assigned to the Higher Education Commission (HEC) under its Ordinance
of 2002, Section 10, Sub-Section 1 (v). In compliance with the above provisions, the
HEC has been undertaking the development of curricula for new/ emerging fields and
revision of curricula after regular intervals through respective National Curriculum
Revision Committees (NCRCs) until 2018.
As a policy change and expanding higher education base under HEC, the curriculum
review and development task has been shifted to the respective regulators and HEIs.
PEC also having mandate under its Act of Parliament and especially after attaining
Washington Accord full signatory status and IPEA licensing authority, took up the
challenge to review and develop the curricula for engineering programs based on
Outcome-Based Education (OBE) System. PEC has therefore constituted an
Engineering Curriculum Review and Development (ECRDC) and also subject ECRDCs
comprising of eminent engineers and professionals from academia and industry to take
up the task of curricula review and updation. Nevertheless, the basic templates
developed by HEC NCRCs have been followed as guidelines.
Under OBE based curriculum review and development framework, PEC held national
and regional levels stakeholders and industrial consultation workshops engaging HEIs,
industry, technical and consulting organizations. The experts’ feedback and suggestions
were translated into the curriculum review process taking into consideration of the
dynamics of technological advancement, industrial needs and management-cum-soft
skills for engineering graduates.

Curriculum of Software Engineering


This curriculum document would serve as a guideline whereas allowing HEIs to tame/
change within the framework by introducing courses in support of local/ required
industrial demand as well as satisfying 12 GAs (Graduate Attributes) covering core and
elective courses, considered as beauty of OBE system in the international environment.
At the same time, this curriculum framework would fulfill our national, social and
economic needs leading towards attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs-
2030). It would also provide the level of competency specified in Pakistan Qualification
Framework to make it compatible with international educational standards.

1. Engineering Curriculum Review & Development Committee
   (ECRDC)
PEC in its efforts towards quality engineering education, took up the challenge of
curriculum review and development for engineering programs after due consent of
HEC. A high level Engineering Curriculum Review and Development Committee
(ECRDC), led by Prof Engr Dr Fazal Ahmad Khalid, Chairman Punjab HEC/ Vice
Chairman PEC, was constituted whereas other eminent members are from industry and
academia to take up the task of curricula review and updation, besides developing
curriculum for new/ emerging fields. The main responsibility of ECRDC is to oversee
the entire curriculum review and development process while setting policies and
guidelines for the subject ECRDCs working in their respective domains. The 1st
meeting of main ECRDC was held on 29th June, 2018 at PEC HQ, Islamabad, wherein
the Convener briefed the scope, objective and ToRs of the Committee and also
formulated the subject ECRDCs comprising of eminent engineers and professionals
from academia and industry.

3. OBE-Based Curriculum Development Framework
Outcome Based Education (OBE) is an approach of teaching and learning that focuses
on what students should be able to attain at the end of the educational program. OBE is
a student-centered system which concerns what the students will know and be able to
do as learning outcomes. The curriculum development under OBE is therefore an
integration of graduate attributes and stakeholders’ feedback in cognizance with
institution’s Vision and Mission.

4. PDCA Approach to Curriculum Design and Development
The process of curriculum design and development constitutes various interconnected
elements with the objective of achieving the intended purpose of the program. The Plan-
Do-Check-Act approach (PDCA) as explained below has been followed in the
curriculum development and review process.




Plan. This stage begins with an analysis of the stakeholders' needs of faculty, current
and past students, employers and society in general. The stakeholders' needs are
translated into human resource terminology i.e. graduate competencies which in turn
translated into educational taxonomy and learning outcomes. Based on the learning
outcomes, curriculum is designed backward to meet PLOs.

                                                Bachelor of Engineering Program (2020)



Do. The plan stage is implemented where curriculum is delivered and learning outcomes
are assessed to gauge the achievement of PLOs.
Check. This stage involves the analysis of assessment results and feedback from
students and faculty. Areas for improvement are identified.
Act. When the learning outcomes are achieved, the curriculum, learning and teaching
strategies and assessment methods are standardized. Best practices are shared and
improvement is made for the next cycle of PDCA.

8. Program Salient Features
The undergraduate engineering program has been based on the following salient
features:

       Duration:                                    4 years
       Number of Semesters:                         8
       Total number of credit hours:                130 - 136
        o   Engineering Domain:                      minimum 85 Credit Hours
        o   Non-Engineering Domain:                  minimum 30 Credit Hours
            (HEIs have flexibility of 15-21 Credit Hours to add courses either in
            Engineering, Non-Engineering or both Domains to fulfill the program
            objectives in line with the overall Vision/ Mission of the Institute
            concerned).
       Additional Course or Credit Hours Requirements: Any addition of course
        or credit hour requirements as per direction or policy of the Government
        (Provincial or Federal), HEIs have leverage to cater such needs over and above
        the prescribed requirements in this document.

       Number of weeks per semester:                15 - 18
       Number of credit hours per semester:         15 - 18
       Curriculum: The engineering curriculum is the most important instrument for
        grooming the students based on 12 Graduate Attributes (GAs) encompassed
        under the Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs). In order to inculcate different
        dimensions of thinking – mathematical, computational, design and creative –
        among students in Cognitive, Psychomotor and Affective domains, the
        curriculum is based on the following knowledge profiles:
        WK1 - Natural Sciences: A systematic theory-based understanding of
              natural sciences applicable to the discipline.
        WK2 - Mathematics and Computing: The concept-based mathematical
              thinking, numerical analysis, statistics and formal aspects of
              computer and information science to support analysis and modeling
              applicable to the discipline.

                                           Bachelor of Engineering Program (2020)



   WK3 - Engineering Fundamentals: A systematic, theory-based
         formulation of engineering fundamentals required in an engineering
         discipline.
   WK4 - Engineering Specialization: The knowledge of Engineering
         specialization that provides theoretical frameworks and bodies of
         knowledge for the accepted practice areas that are at the forefront in
         a discipline.
   WK5 - Engineering Design: The Design Thinking Knowledge that supports
         engineering design in a practice area of an engineering discipline.
   WK6 - Engineering Practice: The Knowledge of engineering practices
         (technology) in different practice areas of an engineering discipline.
   WK7 - Engineering in Society: A systematic, comprehension-based
         knowledge of the role of engineers in a society and the professional
         issues related to practicing engineering profession in a discipline:
         ethics and the professional responsibility of an engineer to public
         safety including the impact of an engineering activity i.e. economic,
         social, cultural, environmental and sustainable
   WK8 - Research Literature: Engagement with selected knowledge in the
         research literature of the discipline.
The curriculum matrix covering above knowledge profiles should therefore be
composed of non-engineering domain (humanities, math, management and natural
sciences), and engineering domain with computer science, foundation, breadth,
depth and multidisciplinary courses (including safety) so that different streams
could be encouraged within each discipline, enabling students to undertake a range
of Complex Problem Solving and Complex Engineering Activities. The
students may select electives from any of the streams with guidelines from their
respective advisors.

        o   A final year design project (FYDP) is the confluence of an engineering
            program. Undertaking a final year design project is a compulsory
            requirement. It should mainly comprise literature search, individual
            analysis, modeling and simulation, AI (Artificial Intelligence) and
            computational data analytics, design and putting together various
            hardware, software, firmware and Algorithm Engineering / Informatics
            related to the program to demonstrate a functional concept including rapid
            prototyping, where applicable.
        o   The FYDP shall include complex engineering problems and design
            systems, components or processes integrating core areas and meeting
            specific needs with appropriate consideration for public health and safety,
            cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.
        o   A project of this nature should invariably lead to an integration of the
            knowledge and practical skills as mandated in the program outcomes. In
            this context, projects of multidisciplinary nature should be encouraged.
        o   The FYDP should span over two consecutive semesters, i.e. semester 7 &
            8, totaling 6-credit hours and should be fully supervised, assessed and
            reflected in the transcripts under a prescribed mechanism so as to prepare
            for joining industry after graduation.
       Faculty: The faculty must be trained for the Outcome-Based Education (OBE)
        system. Their familiarity with the program objectives and outcomes,
        understanding of the Outcome-Based Assessment (OBA) cycle, enthusiasm
        for developing an effective program, and the ability to become an active player
        in this regard are the keys to ensure the attainment of program objectives. The
        faculty is expected to have the ability to ensure proper implementation of the
        program, and to develop processes for evaluation, assessment and CQI. A
        formal training program to groom the faculty should be instituted to become
        effective instructors in applying pedagogical skills in all aspects of Teaching,
        Learning and Assessment covering all domains of Knowledge, Skills and
        Attitude.
       Personal Grooming: Personal Grooming of young faculty members and
        students is very important in order to develop and support their professional
        skills. Therefore, it is required that HEIs should conduct/arrange sessions or
        counseling hours on regular basis to provide guidance for personal grooming.
        Personal Grooming is important for positive self-image and increasing the

                                          18

        confidence level of the individuals. It would help in enhancing students’ self-
        esteem and would go a long way in developing an attractive personality by
        adopting habits like personal hygiene, clothing, appearance, interaction and
        expressive skills, etc. The students should be motivated and equipped to be
        entrepreneurs in their relevant field.
       Presentation and Communication Skills: Special focus should be given to
        inculcate communication and presentation skills amongst the graduates
        through individual and group presentations, technical writing and discussions,
        throughout the program as a regular feature.
This curriculum has been designed to guide and facilitate the universities and
departments to formulate their own programs according to the industrial needs,
emerging trends and recent developments in the field of Software Engineering. The
HEIs have flexibility to incorporate changes in the proposed curriculum within given
range of credit hours for engineering and non-engineering domain.

Ministry of Information Technology & Telecommunication
Government of Pakistan

Minister’s Message
“Our IT vision is to put in place an accelerated digitization ecosystem to enable
socio-economic development, to expand knowledge-based economy and to
spur the economic growth.”

Syed Amin ul Haque
Federal Minister
Ministry of Information
Technology &
Telecommunication

The rapid adoption of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) is immensely
important for the socio-economic development
of the country. In the spirit of democratic
governance, revolutionary policies and visionary
approach, the present government’s main focus is
to enhance the growth of Pakistan’s economy. The
efforts are paying off as the IT industry is growing
in terms of the number of companies, revenue,
exports and workforce every year thereby
demonstrating clear confidence in the ability of the
local companies to deliver IT solutions and services
which meet the expectations of foreign clients.
I am pleased to inform you that with more than
10,000 software houses and call centers at present,
Pakistan’s IT industry is now a well-established
IT services provider to clients across the globe.
Many Pakistani IT companies serves the world’s
largest companies as their clients. You might find
it interesting to note that according to Global Gig
Economy Index 2019, Pakistan is ranked as the 4th

most popular country for freelancing in the world.
Pakistan’s ICT Industry has been a resounding
success story for Pakistan, having achieved a
stellar remittance inflow growth rate and being
the largest net exporter in the services sector.
The Government believes in leading initiatives
pertaining to IT Growth. Honorable President
of Pakistan is leading Ministry of IT’s initiatives
regarding Emerging Technologies and allied
verticals. The Government believes to facilitate
investment in IT/ITES Sector. To match this
spirit, Ministry of IT & Telecom has an open
door policy to provide facilitation round the
clock, be it any foreign or domestic investor
interested
in
IT/ITES
Business
growth.
I invite you to consider Pakistan’s IT industry for
investment and outsourcing at substantial annual
cost savings but with the same IT service quality and
standards as in other countries and to capitalize
on the economic growth in the local economy.

Secretary’s Message
PSEB is mandated to promote Pakistan’s IT industry
across the globe. IT companies have largely benefited
from PSEB’s initiatives by generating valuable business
leads, establishing strategic linkages in foreign
locations and signing outsourcing contracts with their
foreign counterparts.

Shoaib Ahmad Siddiqui
Federal Secretary
Ministry of Information
Technology &
Telecommunication

Pakistan’s IT industry has indeed done well and
due credit goes to the enterprising entrepreneurs
and skilled workforce for coming up with creative
and imaginative solutions. Pakistani IT companies
consistently receive recognition at International
competitions such as Asia Pacific Information
and Communication Technology Awards (APICTA)
in different categories including startup, mobile
applications, e-learning, e-health, e-government,
security, supply chain management, communications,
and financial applications.
The Ministry of IT & Telecom, through Pakistan
Software Export Board, continues to support all
credible private sector initiatives aimed at bolstering
the local IT industry and to attract foreign investment.
We believe in ensuring fast track approach to facilitate
IT foreign companies for business expansion. With an

open door policy, we are here to facilitate companies
interested in business investment/ growth in IT/
ITES Sector, E-Commerce, E-Governance and other
IT’ related verticals. This Ministry is working hard to
ensure pro-investment IT policy initiatives with an
inclusive policy development process in the country.
The Government realizes that it has an important role
in terms of providing a conducive environment to IT
industry through infrastructure and HR development.
PSEB has been playing a key role in promoting IT
industry in the past and I hope that it will continue
to play an even bigger role in the future to contribute
towards Pakistan’s economic growth.

MD’s Message

Osman Nasir
Managing Director
Pakistan Software Export
Board

The IT sector has achieved consistent,
consecutive year on year growth that can
be the envy of any industry anywhere in
the world and is a superstar on its way
to possibly becoming the largest foreign
exchange earner for Pakistan. Already, the IT
industry is among the top five net exporters
of the country with the highest net exports in
the services industries. Pakistan’s IT industry
is exporting products and services to the
world’s largest entities in over 120 countries.
PSEB is being modernized as a front leading
global business development and marketing
organization to supercharge the growth of
Pakistan’s technology exports, which would
address the supply-side issues such as
physical and digital infrastructure availability,
human resource enablement, access to
capital, marketing initiatives, and policy
initiatives from behind the borders. Taking
the momentum of our supply-side initiatives,
we will be looking to execute business
development efforts to generate demand
from beyond the borders.
PSEB recognizes the fact that our technology
industry has traditionally been focused
around
the
Karachi-Lahore-Islamabad
factor, including only 17% of the country’s
population. It is critical to understand
that we can only get to our $10 Billion of
technology exports target by triggering
the tech ecosystem across the remaining
83% of the population. Secondary cities of
Pakistan are now being given priority for
establishing Software Technology Parks,
while the PSEB registration fee for IT & ITeS

companies, including call centers and IT
startups, belonging to underserved areas of
the country has been waived. PSEB is also
evangelizing the possibility of revitalizing
defunct industrial units for conversion into
Business Process Outsourcing Centers/
Software Technology Parks, and potential
Cloud data centers, through Public-Private
Partnerships.
The immense global demand for technology
solutions and services generated through
the COVID-19 inflicted enterprise digital
transformation, and the steady handling
of COVID’s impacts by the Government
of Pakistan calls for immediate training of
thousands of new IT professionals to sustain
the flow of orders. PSEB is launching several
programs to train the bottom of the pyramid
and the middle of the pyramid technology
professionals in partnership with the IT
industry’s trade body P@SHA and industry
training partners.
Software Houses and BPO centers registered
with PSEB have reached a figure of 2860
by 31st December 2020, out of more than
10,000 tech companies actively registered
in Pakistan. The increased business demand
has seen the revenues of these entities
soaring significantly and consistently,
crossing $1.23 Billion.
The sustained growth of the technology
freelancing phenomenon is now prominently
registering itself on the export scoreboard.
Bringing in approximately 10% of the total
technology revenues, PSEB is working on
a comprehensive facilitation package, in

partnership with various organizations
which could potentially include collateralfree business loans and health insurance

The number of IT companies is
increasing every year as the younger
population prefers to run their entities
instead of attempting to seek public
sector jobs like their predecessors.
This is helped by solid support from
the government and a plethora of
public and private sector entities
are prioritizing the growth of the IT
Industry. The startup culture has come
of age at a breakneck speed with
success stories coming out every year.
The government considers the Startup
community, freelancers, developers
and software, and IT students an
important pillar of its strategy.
Pakistan’s IT industry counts the world’s
largest entities among its regular
clients and is providing services to 120
countries around the globe. Pakistan’s
IT industry is vibrant, and the industry

has its interest watching association
(P@SHA). Multiple entities at both
provincial and federal levels are working
to ensure that the industry growth
is enhanced and that friction points
that may impede industry growth
are minimized. Bentley, Ciklum, IBM,
Mentor Graphics, S&P Global, Symantec,
Teradata, and VMware had established
consulting services centers, research
& development facilities, and BPO
support services centers in Pakistan.

Companies Registration Analysis
according to SECP
There is a consensus among private
and public sector industry experts
that the IT industry has the potential to
become the largest foreign exchange
earner for Pakistan. The multipronged
efforts are bearing fruit as the number
of IT companies registered with the
Security and Exchange Commission of
Pakistan has surged to more than 10,000
active companies making information
technology the second largest sector

in Pakistan’s economy after trading.
The Year 2020 witnessed the largest
number of IT company registrations,
with 2,826 companies registered with
SECP compared to 395 companies
registered in 2014. The trend is expected
to continue as efforts are underway
to expand Pakistan’s tech ecosystem
beyond Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad.

Break Down of Companies by City
The largest concentration of IT
companies in Pakistan is in Pakistan’s
second-largest city, Lahore, with 3,567
companies. The federal capital of

Pakistan, Islamabad, comes in second
with 2,680 companies. Islamabad,
Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Karachi
currently account for around 90% of all
IT companies registered with SECP.

New Companies registered with
SECP between 2014-2020

Companies by Registration Type
The IT Industry in Pakistan comprises
SMEs. For this reason, majority of the
companies registered with SECP are

the reasons for the rapid growth of
Pakistan’s IT industry is burgeoning
entrepreneurship in Pakistan’s IT sector.
A majority of the companies, being
SMC or private limited, have significant
room for growth, thereby presenting
opportunities for prospective investors
looking for solid returns.

GovTech
The GovTech term refers to the
efforts made to digitize public
administrations through innovative
technological solutions. GovTech
aims to make the public sector
more innovative, more nimble,
more light-footed and responsive
to effectively address the needs of
citizens. GovTech aims to utilize the
limited resources to deliver public
services better. Technology and
Artificial intelligence are the tools
that finally have the power to radically
reengineer the governments.
Slow or lackluster adoption of
technology fosters inefficiency, poor
quality of government services,
dissatisfied public. The use of
technology by Pakistani entities needs
to be accelerated and government
entities pushed to adopt technology
to make the public sector better and
more responsive while enhancing
efficiency and accountability. Faster
adoption of Gov tech would enhance
Pakistan’s
economic
growth,
reduce poverty and surely improve
Pakistan’s ranking on vital charts such

as ease of business besides radically
enhancing interaction between
citizens and public sector entities.
It would also force upon Pakistani
entities to improve their respective
capacity and therefore competence
in achieving the mandates assigned
to them.
Transparency and Accountability
metrics also skyrocket through the
correct adoption of GovTech. The
adoption of technology by public
sector entities is typically slow
because of resistance to change and
a preference towards the comfort
of the status quo. Within Pakistan
the adoption of technology varies
greatly between various government
entities whether federal or provincial
but significant progress has been
made with Pakistani IT companies
delivering state-of-the-art GovTech
solutions to Pakistani and overseas
entities.

public sector entities such as NADRA
make effective use of GovTech.
Many Pakistani public sector
entities have online methods to
submit applications, view updates,
pay vehicle registration dues
As mentioned earlier, Pakistan’s
international ranking in the rooster of
countries would improve significantly
with the adoption of GovTech. The
need of the hour, therefore, is to
ensure a central channel that would
push the public sector entities to
accelerate the process of adoption
of the latest technologies such as
AI and machine learning. This would

also help enhance the development
of GovTech companies in Pakistan
and this helps in developing strong
clusters of GovTech companies.
The Government of Pakistan is
taking proactive measures to be
more responsive to its citizens.
For instance, National Database &
Registration Authority (NADRA) has
gained international recognition for
its success in providing solutions
for identification, e-governance and
secure documents that deliver multipronged goals of mitigating identity
theft, safeguarding the interests

Securities and Exchange Commission

electronic certificate of incorporation
which is yet another step to make
the company incorporation process
fully electronic and hassle-free and
is in line with corporate registries

of developed countries. End-to-end
automation of services through the
use of modern technology is on top
of the agenda of SECP. E-Office is a
step forward into an era of paperless

offices. It is a digital workplace
solution that replaces the existing
method of manual handling of files
and documents with an efficient

Currently, the GovTech market is
estimated to be worth over US$
400 billion. With an extraordinary
growth rate of 15%, it is expected
to hit US$ 1 trillion by 2025. This
market value exceeds other popular
industries, such as FinTech or
Cybersecurity, with estimated values
of US$ 130 billion and US$ 150billion
respectively.

Skilled Workforce
The tech industry requires highly
skilled and requires state of the art
expertise. IT industry operates on the
cutting edge and hence manpower
the skills need to be constantly
updated.
The IT industry’s dependence on
skilled labor is a matter of survival, far
more so than traditional industries.
The growth of IT Industry
is,
therefore directly dependent on
the availably of a highly skilled labor
force. Approximately, 25,000 IT
graduates enter Pakistan’s workforce
each year, thus providing Pakistani
IT industry with the much-needed
workforce. Pakistan’s IT Industry
growth has been augmented by the
fact that costs remain low for the IT
industry due to a plethora of factors
such as low labor cost and strong
government incentives. The average
annual cost of a software engineer
in Pakistan is one fifth of the cost in
USA and Europe. Pakistan is ranked
5th most financially attractive
location in the world for offshore
services, according to A.T. Kearney’s
Global Services Location Index 2019.

The tech industry requires technical,
domain intensive expertise for
producing high value IT products
and services that are needed by
world’s largest entities. It also needs
innovative entrepreneurs who can
take risks and can operate at the
bleeding edge of technology and
rapidly evolving business models.
The need of the hour therefore is
to ensure that Pakistan can provide
trained manpower to the IT Industry
as per its requirements. For this
to happen effectively, there needs
to be strong collaboration and
collaboration between IT industry,
academia and other relevant public
and private entities. Pakistan also
needs to nurture support and
encourage tech entrepreneurship
in the industry among the youth
of the country as traditional
industrialists are more often than
not, reluctant to foray into new
areas of technology and the same
is true for the older entrepreneurs.
Pakistan needs to develop, support
and sustain a culture of innovation.

This is necessary to ensure
growth of cutting-edge IT industry
in Pakistan and to move up the
value chain in rapid succession.
Universities need to be more focused
on encouraging entrepreneurship
and all need to have viable
entrepreneur
support/startup
support ecosystems. They also need
to develop and nurture minds with a
skew towards innovation and positive
disruption. Pakistan also needs to
have strong Venture Capital Support
ecosystem for entrepreneurs and
to develop this, economists and
finance experts should be enlisted
for developing strong and solid
venture capital funding channels
for the development of Pakistan’s IT
Industry.

During the last several years
the number of freelancers has
been increasing exponentially in
Pakistan, and the number of clients
and projects has been increasing.
The most popular positions of the
orders in the freelance market are
web development, logo designing
and programming. The steady
growth in the number of freelancers
in Pakistan has been identified.
During FY 2019-20 with exports to
120+ countries, including the US$
150 million earned by freelancers.

to Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad
in search of opportunities thereby
further expanding and cementing
the status of the aforementioned
tech hubs at the expense of tertiary
and secondary cities economic
growth.

PSEB is making strong efforts to
establish Technology Parks all over
the country, with particular focus
on secondary and tertiary cities
of Pakistan. This includes far flung
locations such as the Northern
Areas of Pakistan, where thought of
establishing a Software Technology
Park would not have crossed
anyone’s mind just a few years ago.
In order to expedite establishment
of Software Technology Parks, PSEB
is also making efforts to convert
unused and defunct buildings in to
Software Technology Parks in order

The IT industry which by its very
nature, is not dependent on a
vast eco system of supply chains
and is not bound by geographical
constraints as well. The IT companies

to expedite the process.
The development of IT industry
in secondary and tertiary cities of
Pakistan would have significant
positive repercussions for their
economic growth in terms of
generating economic growth and
preventing brain drain to major tech
hubs. Other benefits of a technology
park include development of a
related ecosystem, such as a strong
science base in the surrounding
areas of a science and technology
park. The tenants of a technology
parks drive this growth out of
necessity and hence benefits the
surrounding areas. It also results in
development of the city as has been
the case with many cities around
the globe, most famous of which
is Silicon Valley. It also allows for
development of an entrepreneurial
culture as tenants of the technology
park nurture talent which results in

fostering startups technology experts
and entrepreneurs. Over time, it
also results in the development of
financial ecosystem, especially seed
and venture capital. These resources
are critical to support long-term STI
initiatives and build upon existing
research.

Software Technology Park
in Gilgit
A state-of-the-art Software Technology
Park was established in Gilgit recently.
Several IT companies have already
relocated their business operations
to the Gilgit STP providing services to
customers around the globe and the
facility currently has fully occupied by
IT companies. In four months, since the
inception of Gilgit Software Technology
Park, 8 companies have expanded
from 73 professionals to nearly 200
professionals. Previously, due to a lack
of viable IT industry in Gilgit, young
software experts and engineers from
these areas had to move to other cities.
Among many success stories from
Gilgit is an IT company, Dot Austere,
a software & design agency. Another
example is SheDev, which is an
all-female company providing tech
solutions to customers. They are
currently providing services to local
and international customers.

The Gilgit Software Technology Park
has been a roaring success and would
contribute to the efforts to create
a robust IT ecosystem in Gilgit and
contribute to the efforts to develop the
economy of the region.
Pakistan has improved its position
in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing
Business Index for the second
consecutive year as per World Bank’s
latest rankings. Pakistan’s position on
the index improved by 28 points from
136 to 108 which is an “unprecedented
improvement”, as quoted in the World
Bank report.
As per World Bank Report, Pakistan
improved its position by 58 points in
the “Starting a Business” indicator.
Pakistan’s ranking in this indicator has
improved from 130 to 72 and is placed
at second position in South Asian
countries in terms of ease of starting a
business.

Way Forward
The IT sector is immensely important
to Pakistan’s economy. It has
achieved consistent, consecutive
year on year growth rates that can
be the envy of any industry anywhere
in the world and is a real superstar
on its way to possibly become the
largest foreign exchange earner
for Pakistan. Already, IT industry is
among the top 5 net exporters of
the country with the highest net
exports in the services industries.
The Government has assigned top
priority to the IT sector and has
provided strong incentives for the
growth of IT industry.
Multiple
projects have been
launched to enhance the depth,
capacity and capability of the IT
Industry in Pakistan which include

accelerated establishment of IT parks
all across Pakistan. The government
has a 17-member task force on IT
and telecommunications comprising
members of the tech sector to
advise policy changes and develop
strategic plans to strengthen the
technology ecosystem of Pakistan.
There is strong collaboration and
cooperation between the Public
and private sector entities which is
a precursor for strong IT Industry
growth.

Digital Pakistan Policy

Pakistan introduced its first ‘Digital
Pakistan policy’ back in 2018. The
primary aim of this policy was to
bolster the IT industry by building
a digital ecosystem. Taking a step
forward PM Imran Khan launched
‘Digital Pakistan Vision’ in December

2019 to enhance connectivity,
improving digital infrastructure,
increasing investment in digital skills,
promoting innovation, and tech,
job creation, ending corruption
as well as increasing economic
growth. The Policy focuses achieving
these objectives through access &
connectivity, digital infrastructure, egovernment, digital skills, training &
innovation and entrepreneurship”.

Start-Up Incubators

Start-up ecosystem has come of age
rapidly in Pakistan. There are both
public and private sector entities
supporting the startups by providing
both financial and mentoring
support. There has been significant
startup success from Pakistan
such as Bykea, Careem and Daraz.
Attitudes towards entrepreneurship

has changed drastically in Pakistan
in the past few years. The younger
generation prefers to choose the
startup,
entrepreneurship
and
freelance route as opposed to
seeking jobs. One of the reasons
for this change is widely published
success of Startups both in Pakistan
and internationally. Other reason for
this change is a solid telecom sector
in Pakistan which allows Pakistanis,
even those residing in remote areas
to access the international market.
The current situation is such that a
budding entrepreneur has a choice
of which incubator would he/she
prefer. These include Plan 9, NUST I/O,
LUMS Centre of Entrepreneurship,
i2i, Plan X, Microsoft Innovation
Center, National Incubation Center
among several others.

Among global regions, western Europe
remains a significant contributor, accounting
for approximately one of every five technology
dollars spent worldwide.
China has established itself as a major player
in the global tech market. China has followed
a pattern that can also be seen in developing
regions, where there is a twofold effect of closing
the gap in categories such as IT infrastructure,
software, and services, along with staking out
leadership positions in emerging areas such as
robotics.
Many APEC countries enjoy the twofold effect
of the bulk of technology spending stems from
purchases made by corporate or government
entities.
The allocation of spending will vary from
country to country based on a number of
factors. In the mature U.S. market, for example,
there is robust infrastructure and platforms,
a large installed base of users equipped with
connected devices, and available bandwidth
for these devices to communicate. This paves
the way for investments in the software and
services that sit on top of this foundation.
Tech services and software account for nearly
half of spending in the U.S. technology market,
significantly higher than the rate in many other
global regions. Countries that are not quite as

far along in these areas tend to allocate more
spending on traditional hardware and telecom
services.
The traditional categories of hardware, software
and services account for 56% of the global total.
The other core category, telecom services,
accounts for 26%
The remaining 17% covers various emerging
technologies that either don’t fit into one of the
traditional buckets or span multiple categories
include elements of hardware, software,
and services, such as IoT, drones, and many
automating technologies.
The global Information Technology industry
encompasses the sectors of hardware,
software and services, telecom, and emerging
tech including ‘as-a-service’ solutions under
the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT) and
automating technologies.
The
continuing investment in industrial
automation and digital connectivity around
the world ensures that technology would
remain a growth market during this decade as
companies shift focus from cost reduction to
innovation.
The United States is the world’s largest tech
market, accounting for around one-third of the
total market, and exceeding the gross domestic
product of most other industries. Although the

US market is large, 68% of the global of tech
spending happens outside of the US and is
made by enterprise or government entities.
Western Europe is a major contributor in the
global tech market, and China is also a significant
player with focuses on robotics, infrastructure,
software, and services.

Bachelor of Science in Computational Finance (BSCF)  



Aims & Objectives:The Bachelor of Science in Computational Finance (BSCF) programme is an applied mathematics programme with a focus on finance being a developed application area. BSCF programme consists of courses in mathematics, finance, probability/statistics, and computer applications.
The BSCF degree is uniquely designed to meet the quantitative needs of the finance industry. This course of study develops an in-depth knowledge of mathematics, probability, statistics, and applications of these disciplines to finance. It uses the tools of mathematics, statistics, and computing to solve problems in finance. Computational methods and the mathematics behind them have become an indispensable part of the finance industry.
Computational Finance is an interdisciplinary field covering both mathematical finance and numerical methods. It emphasizes practical numerical methods and focuses on techniques that apply directly to economic analyses. The BSCF programme includes a solid background in mathematics and statistics, as well as a detailed study of financial mathematics. What makes this degree truly unique is its emphasis on business practices. Graduates of the BSCF programme will have a detailed understanding of the economics that drive financial markets and the ability to thrive in the business environment of the financial industry.
 
The BSCF programme includes a solid background in mathematics and statistics, as well as a detailed study of financial mathematics. What makes this degree truly unique is its emphasis on business practices. Graduates of the BSCF programme will have a detailed understanding of the economics that drive financial markets and the ability to thrive in the business environment of the financial industry.
Currently the computational finance has become recognized as a distinct academic subfield. It is also sometimes referred to as ‘financial engineering’, ‘financial mathematics’, ‘mathematical finance’, or ‘quantitative finance’.
Applications and Career Opportunities: Over the last 20 years, the field of computational finance has expanded into virtually every area of finance, and the demand for practitioners has grown dramatically. Moreover, many specialized companies have grown up to supply computational finance software and services.
One of the most common applications of computational finance is within the arena of investment banking. Due to the sheer amount of funds involved in this type of situation, computational finance comes to the fore as one of the tools used to evaluate every potential investment, whether it be something as simple as a new start-up company or a well-established fund.
Another area where computational finance comes into play is the world of financial risk management. Stockbrokers, stockholders, and anyone who chooses to invest in any type of investment can benefit from using the basic principles of computational finance as a way of managing an individual portfolio. Running the numbers for individual investors, just alike for larger concerns, can often make it clear what risks are associated with any given investment opportunity. The result can often be an individual who is able to sidestep a bad opportunity, and live to invest another day in something that will be worthwhile in the long run.
In the business world, the use of computational finance can often come into play when the time to engage in some form of corporate strategic planning arrives. For instance, reorganizing the operating structure of a company in order to maximize profits may look very good at first glance, but running the data through a process of computational finance may in fact uncover some drawbacks to the current plan that were not readily visible before.
Being aware of the complete and true expenses associated with the restructure may prove to be more costly than anticipated, and in the long run not as productive as was originally hoped. Computational finance can help get past the hype and provide some realistic views of what could happen, before any corporate strategy is implemented.
 
A BSCF graduate may also find career opportunities in high performance databases in operational risk management, and measurement is often part of a career in financial technology. Clearing and settling financial transactions is also often a part of a financial technology career.
In summary, the graduates of Computational Finance have brilliant jobs opportunities in Banking sector, Stock market, corporate finance, Collective investment schemes, Credit unions, Investment banks, Pension funds & Trusts etc.
